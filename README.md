# Real Food Calculator Comps Project '18

## Objective:
Every year, data regarding food purchases made by Carleton’s dining halls are compiled in order to be sent off to a tool called the Real Food Calculator made by the Real Food Challenge campaign, which calculates the percentage of food procured by a school that falls within one of the four “real food” categories (local, fair trade, humane, or environmentally friendly). The Real Food Calculator Task Force at Carleton manually goes through receipts collected by Bon Appetit in order to input and reformat information into a configuration that can be accepted by the national Real Food Calculator project. It is a huge, tedious project with great room for error. The goal of this comps project is to streamline the input process by creating a user interface designed to limit and catch errors and implement a centralized data collection source in order to prevent loss and be able to reuse information collected in previous years. After solidifying a way to input and store data, we will implement a software that analyzes the calculator results in ways the Real Food Calculator does not, and generates visual representations for a more thorough and specialized understanding of the real food consumption status at Carleton. With these, we hope to give the Real Food Calculator Task Force and Bon Appetit tools to analyze trends in their real food percentages and the outcomes of potential product shifts.
